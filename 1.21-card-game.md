## The Mission
Make the card game [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-One_(card_game)](21/blackjack).
You do not have to program any of the more difficult features of blackjack, like a dealer, the option to split...

### Must-have features
- Ask the user if he wants to draw a card
- if yes, add a card
- tell him if he bust or not
- make the PC also draw a card and decide to quit or not.
    * Try not to make the PC cheat, make some AI to play "intelligently"
    * Alternativly, use the default casino rule: the dealer keeps drawing until he reaches 15
- When both players stop or bust ask if the player wants to play another round.

- Update the user what happens all the time with prompts and alerts

### Nice-to-have features
- Instead of using prompts, use the images of cards. (very hard!)
- Make a gamble mechanic, every user starts with X chips, and before each round we ask what he wants to gamble. If both the PC and the player bust the wins go to "the house".

### Some personal info about your coach (Koen)
This was the first game I ever programmed in Javascript when I was 16. I was so proud on that accomplishment, I hope you will also feel joy when your version is created!
